					<p>I think we have a very confused relationship with beating video games. For starters, it's a moment of pride and satisfaction, because beating a video game is kind of an accomplishment - it shows skill and commitment. But we might also feel really upset about the fact that we aren't playing that game anymore, especially if it was something we invested in. But then there's the question of whether the game really has to end once we've scoured every area, uncovered every secret in our first playthrough - if there's worth any value in starting it anew.</p>

					<p>That's <strong>replay value</strong> (or <strong>replayability</strong>) in a nutshell - a game's total ability to be played after the initial playthrough. After all, if a game has more content to it after the credits roll, why not run through it a second time? But how do we know that that content exists? How do we know it's fulfilling? And why should this kind of content, the game's replay value, actually matter?</p>

					<p>The reason why we should ask whether replay value matters is because the expectation of fantastic replayability is a standard that video games are constantly held to. It's not infrequent that in a review of a game, the reviewer will use the game's replay value as a major positive or negative. Inherently, this kind of makes sense - after all, I pay upwards of $60 for a large-scale video game now, shouldn't it give me at least as much fulfillment as I paid for?</p>

					<p>In this context, the immediate answer is "well, yeah, every game should have high replay value". But is that true?</p>

					<p>Let's start with situations where replay value definitely <em>does</em> matter.</p>
					<br/>
					<h3 class="text-center">SOME SITUATIONS WHERE REPLAY VALUE DEFINITELY DOES MATTER</h3>
					<br/>
					<p>If we're talking about situations where replay value actually matters, immediately we can think of a few genres/game types where yes, there are absolutely some situations where a game wants or needs high replay value. Games like this thrive on the promise that each playthrough, each experience, can be different than the last.</p>

					<p>First, let's tackle <strong>roguelikes</strong>. Roguelikes are a fascinating breed, because they live or die by their replayability; with their usually high difficulty and RNG, without replay value, this would be a dead genre. Players will generally fail more than they will succeed in roguelikes, but they keep coming back, because roguelikes promise a new and different world every time, and because players know that so much of a roguelike's content is locked behind achievements gained through play.</p>

					<p>Here's an example. Take <em>FTL: Faster Than Light</em>, an indie roguelike about commanding a spaceship and traveling the galaxy. <em>FTL</em> is soul-crushingly hard, even for players good at it, but it's got a wealth of content waiting for players who can learn the game and overcome its difficulty. <em>FTL</em> has a plethora of different, unique ships with different abilities to unlock. Ships are unlocked both by playing through the game with a specific ship and by reaching a random event.</p>

					<div>
						<img style="width:50%;" class="centered block" src="../images/ftl.png"/>
					</div>
					<p class="text-center"><em>A fleet awaits, if you can put in the time and toil to get everyone on board.</em></p>
					<br/>

					<p>All of these ships have totally different difficulties, as well; some will be solid ships right off the bat, others will have a terrible starting kit. But each one is a testament to the player's skill as well as another test for them, because the ships you unlock can unlock even more ships. <em>FTL</em> has more ways to incentivize the player to keep replaying, too; it's got a myriad of skill-heavy ship-specific and general achievements, different difficulty modes, and leaderboards. There's enough content here to hook a player and keep them playing again and again for a variety of reasons. </p>


					<p>Second, <strong>role-playing games</strong>. They've got a ton of emphasis on replay value, because you are meant to inhabit a role within their world. Sometimes the world changes, sometimes it's just you, but in any case, like with roguelikes, there is a huge emphasis on a new experience - but not through unlockables. Both in the physical realm and in the digital, role-playing games thrive on player choice, and try to build an all-encompassing worlds and experiences to accommodate and react to their choices.</p>

					<div>
						<img style="width:50%;" class="centered block" src="../images/SKYRIMnew.png"/>
					</div>
					<p class="text-center"><em>The one thing I can't roleplay as in Skyrim is a normal person. Maybe there's a mod for that.</em></p>
					<br/>

					<p>Nearly every role-playing game, from <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> to <em>Skyrim</em>, relies on how many possibilities are available to bolster their replay value. I might not have liked being a chaotic good warrior, but next time I play, maybe I'll try being a Robin Hood-esque, neutral good thief, with a totally new campaign and party. I might have joined the Companions of Whiterun last time I played Skyrim, but now that I'm playing as a mage, I don't have any reason to join the Companions. And then, of course, there's even deeper character customization, including player-provided backstory.
					These kinds of considerations by players are critical to the experience, and the promise of endless experiences helps these games sell.</p>



					<p>Finally, the best <strong>racing games</strong> rely heavily on having high replay value. Racing games specifically are really interesting because they actually have a dimensionality to their replay values. Players want unlock all the characters, cars, and courses, sure, but there's more; it's like these games are asking, "Hey, your friend just got a faster time than you on that really hard course. You want to show him up?", or "Hey, you got two stars on that last Grand Prix. You think you're good enough to get three?", "Your last lap was 40 seconds long. You're faster than that, right?". The world a player inhabits is the same, but their experience changes as they unlock.</p>

					<p>To use a really interesting (and familiar) example, <em>Mario Kart</em> has been letting players unlock characters for years, but in its most recent iterations, <em>Mario Kart</em> has included not just unlockable karts, but unlockable <em>parts</em>. Players can swap unlocked parts, like kart bodies, wheels, and parachutes, in and out, with one another, increasing or decreasing the various stats of the kart which determine how it drives. This stacks on top of the base character's stats, creating complexity in choice.</p>

					<div>
						<img style="width:50%;" class="centered block" src="../images/mariokart.jpg"/>
					</div>
					<p class="text-center"><em>Pimp my ride. And make sure it has good handling.</em></p>
					<br/>

					<p>Instantly, this makes the game so much more replayable. The game is already polished and fun enough that this just brings players back into its fold. <em>Mario Kart</em>'s roster is already impressive enough that players are naturally enticed to try as many out as they can. If they don't like one, no big deal, just try another or play an old favorite. But with the kart customization system, not only is there additional content players have to unlock, but this content affects how the game is played, and allows a player to create a wholly unique kart suited to their preferences, in addition to choosing their own character. It encourages experimentation.</p>

					<p>With all these examples of games that rely on replay value (and many more that I didn't even touch), naturally, the question arises: when doesn't replay value matter?</p>

					<br/>
					<h3 class="text-center">WHAT VALUE?</h3>
					<br/>

					<p>The games discussed earlier had extremely high replay value, but that was because it was a core part of their identity. They need replayability to match their genre and keep audiences engaged. However, these types of games do not need high replay value because they weren't designed with a second playthrough in mind. Generally, they have a more story-heavy focus, so they don't contain explicit reason to go back and play through the full experience again.</p>

					<p>The games that most commonly break the idea that a game really needs strong replay value are single-player, story-heavy experiences. Despite how much replay value is praised, many players simply do not replay games, especially these kinds of games, which are usually so time-intensive that to play them again would require even more time. These games wrap their stories up nice and tidy, and players get exactly what they want out of the game, so why touch it at all?</p>

					<p>While players are generally split on replayability as an important purchasing factor or as an important feature of the game, for many players, options like <strong>New Game +</strong>, or similarly-named terms for postgame content, mean very little in the way of real replay value. The same goes for features like difficulty settings or bonuses; usually, using such options will not feel like radically new experiences. [4] Yet these are traditional stand-ins for replay value in singleplayer story-driven games, like <em>God of War</em>. [2] If nothing else, this might help indicate an attempt to appease both crowds - that a simple difficulty switch is the best way to provide additional playtime for those who really want it, while those who just want to play another game can do just that.</p>

					<p>Furthermore, some games are such powerful experiences that even if they're extremely high-quality, players might not want to play through it again. One user on Reddit said that they would never play <em>Spec Ops: The Line</em> again because of how powerful (and depressing) its story was. [3] <em>Spec Ops: The Line</em> had elements that one could argue give it some replay value, but clearly, the story holds enough weight that it counters any desire to return to the game, pushing players away from attempting a second playthrough. Instances like this could even demonstrate a sort of artistic choice for a game to <em>not</em> be replayable.</p>

					<p>So where does all of this leave us? Well, we can take away two important lessons from this: <p>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>Whether the game has replay value or not, if the player doesn't feel like a second playthrough is worth their time, they won't play a game a second time.</strong></li>
						<li><strong>High replay value is not necessary for a game to be worth its asking price, so long as low replay value works within the experience.</strong></li>
					</ol>
						
					<p>As such, developers should consider if they want the replay value of the game to be diminished to just a difficulty switch, or if it's a main focus of the experience.</p>

					<p>And this is where we reach a fundamental crossroads in regards to replay value, because we've been dancing around a specific but important point: at some point, replay value is no longer just established by the game, but by the player.</p>

					<br/>
					<h3 class="text-center">THE PLAYER'S REPLAY VALUE</h3>
					<br/>

					<p>It's worth mentioning that some of these games, which have little to no replay value of their own, are still replayed anyway, <strong>just because players want to.</strong> Players might replay a game for any number of reasons, but often, it's not really because it has great replay value to begin with; it's just to enjoy the core offering one more time.</p>

					<p>Take, for example, <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em>. You can beat the game and choose to 100% it (not replaying it, just continuing to play), but your only reward for doing so is this picture:</p>

					<div>
						<img style="width:50%;" class="centered block" src="../images/7e0.png"/>
					</div>
					<p class="text-center"><em>"I do not like this photo, Luigi. Its smug aura mocks me."</em></p>
					<br/>

					<p>This game would appear to have no replay value, because at the very end of your first playthrough, you've seen everything the game has to offer. But people still replay it.</p>

					<p>Despite not having a real, tangible reward for exploring the game fully and getting every secret you can find in the first playthrough and no push from the game to play it again, players have extracted their own replay value. The game means something to them, so even if there's nothing new after this photo, or nothing new when starting a new game, someone can still pick up the game and play it, for whatever reason.</p>

					<p>In this regard, replaying games without an explicit reward or impetus to do so serves a similar purpose as rewatching a movie or rereading a book. Details that were missed on the first expereince suddenly stand out, you pick up on plot threads and ideas more, etc.</p>

					<p>One good example of this desire to dive into and pick apart a game as one might a literary or cinematic work is from the game <em>What Remains of Edith Finch</em>. After beating the game, the most inherent replay value players can really pull out of the game is the achievements. For players more interested in the storytelling, however, restarting the game offers them a chance to explore sections of it that have narrative clues buried within that they missed on the first playthrough. [1] By doing this, the player can extract their own replay value, making the choice to go through it a second time more personally worthwhile.</p>

					<div>
						<img style="width:50%;" class="centered block" src="../images/what-remains-of-edith-finch-screen-03-ps4-us-21mar17.jpeg"/>
					</div>
					<p class="text-center"><em>There's replay value buried in here somewhere.</em></p>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<h3 class="text-center">SO... DOES REPLAY VALUE MATTER?</h3>
					<br/>

					<p>I'll answer that with a resounding <em>"sometimes"</em>. Not exactly satisfying, but at the very least, we can say that as a blanket evaluation, using replay value to signify game quality is flawed at best.</p>

					<p>I think we tend to overvalue replayability. Fundamentally, replay value matters in some genres and games more than others, because such a game's entire value is dependent on players playing it again. But by contrast, some games don't aim for that at all - they shoot for an entirely different experience, sometimes just a one-and-done deal. But neither approach is wrong; it just matters whether that approach is ideal for the game, and if the content added really makes the game worth playing again.</p>

					<p>The choice to replay a game ultimately rests with the player, and more often than not the true replay value of a game depends on their mindset and preferences. Sure, a game might just be begging to be replayed, but I've already had my fill of it, at least for now. Or the game could have been an adventure so satisfying and complete that even though it's all wrapped up now, I immediately want to unwrap it and play it all over again. <strong>It's up to me.</strong> And players can ultimately get their own replay value out of a game, whether it had any replay value originally or not.</p>

					<p>Now that that's settled, I think it's time to play a game with high replay value. Thanks for reading!</p>

					<hr/>

					<p>Since my sophomore year at CMU, I've become a lot more nostalgic. Not that I wasn't nostalgic before, but I think as a consequence of the unrelenting academic brutality of my sophomore year, I just wanted to go back to nicer, simpler, more restful times, as my brain naturally screamed, <em>"Hey, can we just, like, be 10 and playing Pokemon Diamond in the back of Mom's car again? Please? Pretty please?!"</em> Because I was super nostalgia-ridden, though, thinking and writing about games (yeah, not <em>playing</em> them) became my escape from the stresses of college, and naturally I started to think about games I loved in a new light. Specifically, do they still hold up? Did they age poorly? Can I still appreciate them, or even just look at them?</p>

					<p>These are kind of the fundamental questions that <strong>remakes</strong> at least should <em>try</em> to address. I say <em>try</em> because a good remake will address these questions, but because of people like me who get overwhelmed by the power of nostalgia, remakes have become more popular than ever in recent memory, so the drive to create remakes to capitalize on nostalgia can go either very well or very poorly. People clamor for remakes all the time, but the end product they get could end up at either quality extreme, or somewhere inbetween. But what makes one <em>good</em>?</p>

					<p>In an attempt to answer that, I'm going to analyze a few remakes in three areas - <strong>aesthetics</strong>, <strong>gameplay</strong>, and <strong>content</strong> - and see how modifying the original's stance in each one can makes some remakes more successful than others. Keep in mind, however, that this evaluation is largely subjective, because it's reflective of consumer tastes.</p>

					<br/>
					<h3 class="text-center">AESTHETICS</h3>
					<br/>

					<p>Similarly to how it might be defined within the Elemental Tetrad, aesthetics here refers to the game's overall presentation. Aesthetics include a game's artstyle, music, and sound design, and in terms of a remake, it's an extremely powerful force. Aesthetics are important within a remake because if done well, they can interest new players and provide old players with a fresh new way to view and hear the game, or at least make them forget the original, potentially ugly graphics and music. If done poorly, however, it can alienate both sets of players from a remake.</p>

					<p>Tackling the issue of poor changes to a game's aesthetics first, one remake which received serious criticism for how it handled its aesthetics was the 2018 <em>Secret of Mana</em> remake. As a highly-acclaimed, classic game from many of their childhoods, players had high expectations for the remake, as the original was well-loved for its pixel art and soundtrack in addition to its mechanics and story.</p>

					<p>People hated it. Why? Well, take a look.</p>

					<div>

					</div>
					<p class="text-center"><em>Pixel vs. polygon. The great debate. Except here polygons are actually worse.<br/>
					<a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/wp-content/uploads/legacy/secret_of_mana_remake_snes_comparison.jpg">Source</a></em></p>
					<br/>

					<p>The new artstyle, polygon instead of pixel, angered and alienated players both new and old, as it made the remake look significantly clunkier and less colorful than the original, thereby detracting from the overall atmosphere of the game. The remake also remixed the classic soundtrack of the original game, changing instruments and adding melodies that players often described as "dissonant" or "grating" (fortunately, however, the original soundtrack could be played through an option in settings). Both revisions overshadowed any mechanical changes or positives the remake might have had, leading players to conclude that the original was superior because the remake ruined the atmosphere.</p>

					<p>On the opposite end lies <em>Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver Versions</em> (<em>HGSS</em>), remakes of the Game Boy Color games <em>Pokemon Gold and Silver Versions</em>. Like the Secret of Mana remake, <em>HGSS</em> had large expectations placed on them, as many players grew up with <em>Gold and Silver</em>. Unlike with the Secret of Mana, however, <em>Gold and Silver</em> were not beloved for their aesthetics so much as for the new Pokemon, mechanical changes, and postgame content they brought.</p>

					<p>Nonetheless, in the remakes, the aesthetics were given major overhauls, as you can see below.</p>

					<div class="row">

							<br/>
						</div>
					</div>

					<p>That's the same location in both pictures. Yeah.</p>

					<p>Since their release, <em>HGSS</em> have been lauded by many players as not just the best of the Pokemon remakes, but the best game in the series in general, the aesthetics playing no small part in that evaluation. HGSS's art style and art updates made the world and its characters crisp, colorful, and diverse, as concept art for the original games indicated, and as many players imagined. The music likewise got a significant upgrade, remixing tracks by adding instruments and playing with their tempos; moreover, these tracks were remixed on a contextual basis, so they would fit the situation or environment, crucial in a region-exploring game like <em>Pokemon</em>. Rather than replacing the original feeling of discovery and adventure in <em>Gold and Silver</em>, then, the aesthetic changes applied in <em>HGSS</em> actually enhanced that mood.</p>

					<p>So why did <em>HGSS</em> succeed where the <em>Secret of Mana</em> remake failed? I believe it's because the <em>HGSS</em> developers recognized that an overhaul to aesthetics was essential to create the player experience they wanted. Unlike <em>Secret of Mana</em>, <em>Gold and Silver</em> did not start with timeless graphics or music, just ones that worked, and so it was critical to upgrade the aesthetics to not just modernize the games, but create the environment and experience that was meant to be there on the Game Boy. <em>Secret of Mana</em>, on the other hand, established its intended audiovisual experience back when it was originally released, so its aesthetics needed little, if any, revision. The remake failed to recognize the timelessness of the original aesthetics, and in trying to improve on them, overcorrected to where the game was no longer recognizable.
					</p>


					<br/>
					<h3 class="text-center">GAMEPLAY</h3>
					<br/>

					<p>Gameplay, for our purposes, encompasses both mechanics (as original ideas influenced by technology in a remake) and other interactions as well as natural progression within the game itself. Gameplay is crucial to a remake, as it determines how comfortable players are interacting with the remake as opposed to the original. In this area, designers are afforded the ability to correct issues in the original product to make the experience more cohesive. If done well, changes or additions to gameplay can make the game feel modern and lower the barrier to playing to returning players and new ones; if done poorly, the game will feel completely wrong, and players will quickly abandon it.</p>

					<p>Again, let's start with an example that has poor, or at least poorly executed, gameplay (this one saddens me because I actually really like this game). <em>Super Mario 64 DS</em> (<em>64 DS</em>), as the name implies, is a remake of the beloved Nintendo 64 game <em>Super Mario 64</em> for the Nintendo DS. It was released as a launch title for the system in 2004, acting simultaneously as a draw-in for younger players to get hooked on 3D Marios early as well as a reason for older fans who first played <em>Super Mario 64</em> to pick up a DS. <em>Super Mario 64</em>'s defining characteristic is Mario's freedom of movement within the 3D space; this was a revolution when the Nintendo 64 was first released, and it's what people still love about the game today.</p>

					<p>So naturally, it was completely botched in the remake.</p>

					<div>

						<img style="width:50%;" class="centered block" src="../images/unnamed.jpg"/>
					</div>
					<p class="text-center"><em>Looks better. Plays worse? I love it either way.<br/>
					<a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/HUtNLfTaqE9J926IdO4zBtL1csHtfddHrOafnaoKLdZA1z6gD3b3G5IZ0xThjxwlWX9C4TUAA3toJn64z4XuehNL6rI3nGpOEVcjLJt99MC_kIdyM0K_j8-PG4JxG0e90Vs4Fx3GRB4ghKoFvjabiggujHrF33ZW">Source</a></em></p>
					<br/>

					<p><em>64 DS</em> has one major problem, and it's entirely with how Mario moves. Because <em>Super Mario 64</em> was originally released on a console with a joystick on its controller, the game used the joystick's entire range of motion to move Mario. However, in the morve to the DS, which only had a D-pad, the range of motion was drastically reduced, so Mario not only felt more awkward to move (thanks to players having to wrangle the D-pad), he actively couldn't move in certain ways anymore. This compounded on top of additional control awkwardness, such as using shoulder buttons to crouch or refocus the camera. As a result, while new players didn't have many issues, those who had played <em>Super Mario 64</em> before hated controlling Mario.</p>

					<p>As if that weren't enough, <em>64 DS</em> makes a truly baffling decision: it forces the player to play as Yoshi for the first hour or two of the game to unlock Mario, who was available in <em>Super Mario 64</em> immediately. Yoshi wasn't in the original game, but he was added into the remake, along with Luigi and Wario. However, he moves and attacks completely differently from Mario, Luigi, or Wario, making the shift from Yoshi to Mario extremely jarring. New players had to overcome this gap, learning to shift control schemes, and those who had played the original game were frustrated by being forced to play as Yoshi where they hadn't been before.</p>

					<p>Fortunately, there do exist remakes which do improve upon the  gameplay of the originals. As an example, we can look at <em>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D</em> (<em>Ocarina 3D</em>), which, like <em>64 DS</em>, is a remake of a highly respected Nintendo 64 game. The original <em>Ocarina of Time</em> is regarded as a classic for a myriad of reasons, but its strengths include its pervasive atmosphere, epic storytelling, dungeons, and expansive map.</p>

					<p>And thankfully, those were left completely alone in the remake.</p>

					<div>
						<img style="width:50%;" class="centered block" src="../images/03bd8c5c1360d906d4002c0dde04ada7.jpg"/>
					</div>
					<p class="text-center"><em>Double the screens means double the info.<br/>
					<a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/03/bd/8c/03bd8c5c1360d906d4002c0dde04ada7.jpg">Source</a></em></p>
					<br/>

					<p>What <em>Ocarina 3D</em> did do (in addition to giving the graphics a significant bump in quality) was use new features available in its console to improve the gameplay, or give players more options. <em>Ocarina 3D</em> allowed players to use the touch screen to manage items more easily and for quickly checking maps of the dungeon, mitigating the hassle of performing either task, as they were clunky in the original. <em>Ocarina 3D</em> also allowed the player to rotate the 3DS to aim arrows, which allowed for more accuracy. The core gameplay of <em>Ocarina 3D</em> is the same as the Nintendo 64 original, but with tweaks that provide options to or which directly assist the player.</p>

					<p><em>Ocarina 3D</em> successfully iterated on its gameplay by creating additional opportunities for players to use new technology to execute the same mechanics in an intuitive light. The developers understood the pain points that existed in the original game, as much of a landmark as it was. As such, the remake doesn't endanger the gameplay of the original game, instead providing an experience that old and new players enjoy. <em>64 DS</em>, on the other hand, alienated players because its strongest suit was compromised and its gameplay didn't offer players assistance or options, instead restricting them.</p>

					<br/>
					<h3 class="text-center">CONTENT</h3>
					<br/>

					<p>The last aspect I want to touch on here is content. For the purposes of this argument, content refers to objects, characters, locations, dialogue, etc. put into a game that contribute to its overall package. Content includes things like postgame locations, unlockable items, and even the story; generally, more content is better within a game both because it helps a player stay interested in the game and because it can justify a game's price tag; as such, remakes use more or different content to differentiate themselves from an original. A remake with worthwhile content, whether its own or modifications to the original's, can stand on its own and truly make itself a worthy successor to the original, but a remake with a poor content base or which modifies existing content in an unappealing way takes a step back from its own roots.</p>

					<p>One remake that heavily modified its own content was the 2016 remake of the first game in Insomniac Games' classic series <em>Ratchet and Clank</em>. The original <em>Ratchet and Clank</em> became beloved for its cynical edge, dark humor, and explosive, insane combat, so any remake needed to treat these elements respectfully to keep old fans invested. However, unlike the other games in the series, the 2016 remake was actually a movie tie-in game to a film of the same name. Both the film and the game sought to reboot the series and get kids hooked on it.</p>

					<p>This led to the story and weapons, among other things, getting gutted.</p>

					<div>
						<img style="width:50%;" class="centered block" src="../images/ratchet-and-clank-ps4-comp-1-1.jpg"/>
					</div>
					<p class="text-center"><em>Ratchet's much sleeker now. I don't like it.</em><br/>
					<em><a href="https://gearnuke.com/ratchet-clanks-latest-update-also-improves-visuals-regular-ps4-comparison-inside/">Source</a></em></p>
					<br/>

					<p>Though it's exceptionally pretty and feels incredibly nice compared to the ugly, clunky original, the 2016 remake is far more tiring to sit through. The darker, more cynical elements of the original game's story were removed, cutting back on its witty humor and commentary. Instead, the story was made much more kid-friendly by focusing on personal goals of characters that weren't in the original narrative and changing all attempts at humor. This also made our two leads suffer as well; whereas before Ratchet and Clank were both very flawed beings, and had to learn how to work together throughout the game to gradually develop a friendship, the remake made them more generic, where they became friends off the bat and exhibited no flaws throughout the game. Returning players became disappointed in the remake as a result, since it so heavily modified what was before defining characteristic.</p>

					<p>Alongside these changes to the story, the remake changes the weapons players can use, another defining aspect of the original game. It gives Ratchet and Clank the same number of weapons they had in the original, but the vast majority of weapons present in the original game were just removed for seemingly no reason. Instead, they were replaced with well-known weapons from throughout the other games in the series, some of which were functionally similar, but most of which were quite different. Long-time players pushed back on this as well, as these removed weapons were fun, were totally unique to the first entry (or the first several entries), and helped establish the original's "ratchety" feel.</p>

					<p>Content can be changed or added in by a remake without disrupting the original product, however. Earlier I talked about how <em>Super Mario 64 DS</em> (<em>64 DS</em>) had flaws in its gameplay thanks to new content, but the charaters weren't the only pieces of content it added in. <em>64 DS</em> also added in more powerups, collectible Stars, new levels and bosses, and even a minigame suite.</p>

					<p>And this remake actually successfully integrates this new content fairly well.</p>

					<div>
						<img style="width:25%;" class="centered block" src="../images/200px-Picture_Poker.png"/>
					</div>
					<p class="text-center"><em>This is the only game where you can play against Luigi in a casino. See why I love it?</em><br/>
					<em><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=super+mario+64+ds+minigames&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS887US887&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj3p7rPieDnAhWGknIEHY1TCBEQ_AUoAnoECAoQBA&biw=1440&bih=740&dpr=2#imgrc=XtYMhMKpj5geYM">Source</a></em></p>
					<br/>

					<p>Aside from the hiccup from earlier, all of the new content in <em>64 DS</em> meshes near-seamlessly with elements retained from the original. Well-known and well-loved characters like Luigi and Wario were integrated into the game as unlockable content, and they had their own feel and uses to get new specific areas; Luigi was fast and nibmle, while Wario was slow and powerful. They also received unique powerups to allow for even more situations and challenges in gameplay. 30 new Stars were added into the game, along with new, secret areas and methods of unlocking them, adding even more playtime and environments to the game. And to top it all off, players could unlock minigames just by playing the rest of the game. <em>64 DS</em> became even more fun and replayable in this regard, adding to the value already present from <em>Super Mario 64</em>.</p>

					<p><em>64 DS</em> successfully integrated its new content because this content built on top of what was already present in the original rather than replaced it, working off of what was already successful. New content became something curious players sought out to keep exploring the game as well as a reward for that exploration. The remake of <em>Ratchet and Clank</em>, meanwhile, didn't integrate its new content well because that new content replaced existing game-defining content and was weaker or less distinctive than the content it replaced. This completely changed the tone and feeling of the final product, and became such a radical departure from the original that it turned players away.</p>

					<br/>
					<h3 class="text-center">SO WHAT MAKES A GOOD REMAKE?</h3>
					<br/>

					<p>Well, with all that said, I think there are a few things we can pull that seem to be general qualities of a good remake.</p>
					<p>A good remake:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Evaluates and changes the aesthetics of the original game appropriate to whether or not they helped facilitate an engaging player experience.</li>
						<li>Engages older players through its updates to familiar elements and retains newer players through sheer quality.</li>
						<li>Improves on the original gameplay not by shifting important elements around, but by providing the player with more options when playing.</li>
						<li>Judges whether new technology will help or hinder the original product during translation.</li>
						<li>Adds in new content where it can build upon previous work, but does not replace existing content central to the identity of the game.</li>
						<li>Recognizes the strengths of the original game, and tries as hard as possible not to remove them.</li>
					</ul>


					<p>Remakes tend to either overshoot or undershoot in their resemblance to an original game. By striking the appropriate balance between devotion to the old and innovation with the new and recognizing what makes the old work, remakes can make any old game once again feel like a breath of fresh air.</p>

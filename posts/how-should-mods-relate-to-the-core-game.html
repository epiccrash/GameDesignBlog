					<p>Mods are a pretty cool aspect of video games. If nothing else, they're incredible examples of how passionate fans can increase the total value of a game. Mods can change how a game looks, pile on additional engaging and fun content, or even radically overhaul core gameplay. At their best, mods add to the overall value of the base game through the content they provide, giving the player a more meaningful or completely new experience.</p>

					<p>Eventually, however, we might ask: is there a point where the value of mods overtakes the value of the game they change? At some point, does the ability to change a game become its main selling point? And if so, what does that say about the quality of the game itself? Does the capability and willingness to include fan-generated content indicate a lack of substance in the game itself?</p>

					<p>In other words: <strong>how should mods relate to the core game?</strong></p>

					<p>Within this essay, I'll be using the idea of modding as a lens to more closely examine the successes and failings of a game's design, and how mods interact with the game's elements. I'll also be offering examples of mods which highlight these parts when I can. I'll be examining the impacts and implications of mods as they exist through three actions: <strong>adding</strong>, <strong>fixing</strong>, and <strong>overhauling</strong> content, specifically as they relate to <em>Minecraft</em> and <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em>.</p>

					<p>(Also, this is a long, extremely text-heavy post; I'm sorry in advance.)</p>

					<br/>
					<h3 class="text-center">WHAT I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT</h3>
					<br/>

					<p>First of all, I'd like to establish the difference between mods and <em>user-generated content</em> (for the purposes of this post, anyway), and establish that this post discusses the former, not the latter. Both can be valuable depending on the game, but one is secondary, while the other is required.</p>

					<strong>Mods</strong> are external player-created pieces of content that directly change a game originally released as one whole package. While mods may be possible to create for a given game (and the game may even easily facilitate creating those mods), they are not required for players to have the core experience the game offers. Games which have strong mod communities include <em>Minecraft</em> and <em>Skyrim</em>, which were both released with core content and a central experience.</p>

					<p><strong>User-generated content</strong>, by contrast, constitutes content that was intended for a game which actively requires it. User-generated content is not merely helpful for these games; it is necessary to facilitate experiences within them. Games which require this kind of content include <em>Garry's Mod</em>, whose entire value relies on the creation and downloading of maps, gamemodes, NPCs, weapons, and much more on the Steam Workshop, and <em>Dreams</em>, whose value centers on users creating content within the game itself and then sharing it for others to enjoy.</p>

					<p>I focus on mods specifically in this post because their role in extending the value of a game, or otherwise affecting that value, is less apparent than that of user-generated content. User-generated content allows a game to function as intended, so their merit is clear. Mods, on the other hand, can completely disregard a game's original function or radically alter it, and so their full impact on a game is somewhat less apparent.</p>
					
					<p>With that being said: mods, huh?</p>

					<br/>
					<h3 class="text-center">ADDING TO THE GAME</h3>
					<br/>

					<p>The most basic action mods can take is in adding content to the game. Modders can create content that puts interesting and fun new experiences into the game to keep players engaged, whether through the introduction of more items, attacks, NPCs, or whatever. This content generally builds upon the existing structure of the game to introduce new ways to play, without disregarding content in the process.</p>

					<p>Most of <em>Minecraft</em>'s modding community focuses around just adding more content to the game. This very much supports Minecraft's status as an open-ended, player-led experience, as it allows players to install mods to implement or support their own objectives. One of the most-hyped mods in <em>Minecraft</em> was the Aether II mod, which added an entirely new dimension to the game, the Aether, a heavenly counterpart to vanilla <em>Minecraft</em>'s hellish Nether. Aether II expanded <em>Minecraft</em>'s number of mineable blocks and obtainable materials, added several new mobs and structures, and even implemented its own dungeons and boss fights. The mod was also quite difficult, compounding on top of <em>Minecraft</em>'s own difficulty. All of these factors enabled Aether II to build upon Minecraft's baseline and use Minecraft's own mechanics and content while integrating some of its own.</p>

					<p>Additionally, <em>Skyrim</em> has a plehtora of mods which add swaths of content to the game. <em>Skyrim</em> is an isolated single-player experience, so the idea of modding it initially seems quite strange, but as a game that allows players to experience their own adventure in a mythical (and unintentionally funny) fantasy world, <em>Skyrim</em>'s core is greatly supported by additive mods. For example, several <em>Skyrim</em> mods, such as Falskaar, are such enormous additions to the game that they constitute new areas on the map. Falskaar and mods like it add entire landmasses to the game, expanding the map and adding new threats and treasure. Players downloaded Falskaar because it offered a new experience that connected to Skyrim's core experience: adventuring in a mysterious, unfamiliar land.</p>

					<p>Mods which act additively to a game's design and experience reveal the games' modular (or at least somewhat modular) components. These are parts which can be easily manipulated through and integrated with mods to affects the core experience without breaking the atmosphere of the game. Players who add content to the game via mods do so with respect to the rest of the game itself, tying some of the base game into the new mod, This is ultimately good, because this kind of functionality makes players think of the mod on a more fundamental level, and allows them to see the mod as fundamentally integrated into the game.</p>

					<p>But then again, does a desire to insert new content into a game indicate that the game simply lacks content? I would argue that given the wide, varied nature of this type of action, generally, no. It's also probably not indicative of poor design. Instead, this act refers to activities and experiences the players wish to do and have within the boundaries of the game. In the cases of <em>Minecraft</em> and <em>Skyrim</em>, the mods kept people engaged in their respective games, as they integrated the core aspects and gameplay of each game and greatly expanded what players could see and do within them. Ultimately, the tendency to create additive mods speaks positively to the base game's ability to maintain its atmosphere and create mechanics and components that players want to engage with even more.</p>

					<p>Adding content could, however, indicate poor design should the new content outclass what the base game actually holds. Players who install a mod that adds a new kind of dungeon into the game, for example, could be doing so because the base group of dungeons are boring or otherwise uninteresting - in other words, a failure to provide the ideal experience for the player. A situation like this actually has arisen in both <em>Skyrim</em> and <em>Minecraft</em>.</p>

					<p><em>Skyrim</em>'s lack of real choices for what content its players homes should hold caused them to feel largely the same and fail to provide a place for players to actually do everything they wanted to. This led to the rise of many player home mods that offered new homes with all crafting areas present within it, or with additional content. Additionally, <em>Minecraft</em>'s lack of clarity in how to craft items required players to leave the game and go to the wiki to find out recipes. This led to the rise of mods which enabled players to check crafting recipes from a list of items.</p>

					<!--p>Examining what kinds of mods are frequently added to the game can inform developers what areas of the game might need more attention.</p-->

					<br/>
					<h3 class="text-center">FIXING THE GAME</h3>
					<br/>

					<p>Additive mods may tend to generally help the game experience for players, but the place of mods get more questionable when players begin fixing problems that exist in the original game. Mods can fix graphical issues, AI bugs, incomplete content, and anything else that escaped QA testing (or just couldn't be implemnented in time for release). Rather than keeping players engaged in the game through new experiences, these mods address existing technical problems within the core experience.</p>

					<!-- Unofficial Skyrim Patch, VanillaFix and OptiFine -->

					<p>For example, for as beloved as it is, <em>Minecraft</em> is also well-known to be extremely poorly optimized. While this wasn't a huge problem originally, as <em>Minecraft</em> evolved and updated over time, it became much larger in size, putting more strain on computers which could previously run the game perfectly fine (I remember Minecraft running for maybe 16 FPS on my old computer several years ago; with friends, it was just unplayable). Players' solution to this became OptiFine, a mod which not only allows players to make the infamously ugly <em>Minecraft</em> look beautiful via HD textures, but actually makes <em>Minecraft</em> run much faster. Many players install OptiFine for the optimization fix alone.</p>

					<p>There's also <em>Skyrim</em>, possibly one of the most broken AAA releases in the last 10 years. Many players find <em>Skyrim</em> extremely fun in spite of its problems, but regardless of its content, <em>Skyrim</em> is known to have severe graphical bugs, major collision problems, and questline and NPC interaction issues, among other things (players often joke about the sometimes-lovable, sometimes-hated "Skyrim jank" and invoke the name of Todd Howard). To this end, <em>Skyrim</em> has many mods which are dedicated solely to patching its issues, including the Unofficial Skyrim Patch, which has aimed to fix every major issue present within <em>Skyrim</em>. The mod is so beneficial to the core game and fixes so many issues with it that players on forums near-unanimously agree that it should be installed before the game is even booted up.</p>

					<p>These kinds of mods beg the question: why do modders have to do developers' work, and fix underlying problems in the game? If modders are able to amend major issues, are the developers just lazy? Well, I would argue that in most cases, no. To play devil's advocate here, these issues can be fixed by modders more often than not because these major problems arise most frequently from the game's most buried source code or the engine itself. While the developers themselves may know this source code well, their attention is split between several projects, and improving a previously-released game may not even be on the radar, since it already shipped. Modders, on the other hand, can poke around in the game's source code, and isolate and amend problems because they have the time and knowledge of what the major problems are.</p>

					<p>I would argue, however, that if developers continue to work on a game, or when they rerelease a game, they should try to improve these problems, both for the game's sake and for that of their relationship with their players. While mods can be a short-term solution, they are generally only long-term fixes once the developer has actually moved on from the game, and if the developer doesn't solve these problems themselves while they continue to add content, the game's community can get increasingly frustrated. To this day, <em>Minecraft</em> is still unoptimized, and <em>Skyrim</em> still has major, gamebreaking problems. Mods have provided solutions to their problems, but though that may be the case, while developers are devoting resources to a project, they should endeavor to fix technical issues as well as content ones, especially since technical issues are the far more immersion-breaking problems.</p>

					<p>On one hand, it's admirable that these players would go so far as to delve deep into the game's code and correct sometimes common issues and glitches. This demonstrates that the game has garnered a real community, and that it does have some kind of impact and sustaining power. On the other hand, it is an admittedly awkward situation to download a mod specifically to fix problems the developers overlooked or haven't addressed, and the need to download such a mod is a mark of a problem with the game's core experience.</p>

					<br/>
					<h3 class="text-center">OVERHAULING THE GAME</h3>
					<br/>

					<p>The final category of mods I want to discuss are mods which actually overhaul parts of the game. These take existing parts of the base game (or the entire game itself) and radically shift them to provide a different experience. In other words, rather than adding to or amending the game's core, these mods actually change the core in some deeper or more significant way, such that it provides a new or more valuable game experience to players.</p>

					<!-- Mods: SkyUI, Apocalypse, Pixelmon -->

					<p><em>Minecraft</em> has some mods which drastically overhaul parts of its game, but these tend to shift the entire experience rather than just modify one aspect of the game (like redoing spawn rates and Zombie AI, what ores actually spawn in the world, or how the crafting system works). One such major overhaul is Pixelmon, a mod which adds in <em>Pokemon</em> to <em>Minecraft</em>, and enables the player to capture, train, battle, trade, and breed them as they might in any mainline <em>Pokemon</em> game. Pixelmon might be one of the single most ambitious mods in <em>Minecraft</em>'s history; in addition to rewriting which mobs spawn, Pixelmon also overhauls the appearance and buildings of villages, so that they are filled with Pokemon Centers and Poke Shops, and lets players obtain resources from Pokemon defeated in battle. This actually fundamentally changes how the player interacts with <em>Minecraft</em> and how they interact with the <em>Pokemon</em> experience; now, players must not only search for resources in Minecraft to build items that let them catch and train Pokemon, but actively seek out Pokemon so that they can succeed and survive in <em>Minecraft</em>. This is an amazing interplay between the mod and the game, so such so that an entirely new focus is formed.</p>

					<p><em>Skyrim</em> also has mods which overhaul parts of its core experience; these mods range in scale from UI changes to allow for a more seamless player experience to an entire rethinking and redesign of the existing magic system. Funnily enough, I have two mods which illustrate those exact aspects extremely well - SkyUI and Apocalypse. SkyUI completely redoes <em>Skyrim</em>'s UI, such that it no longer resembles the console-style selection it had before. This is a major plus, since interacting with <em>Skyrim</em>'s UI on a computer felt awkward and frequently led to selecting the wrong potion or dialog option. Much like the Unofficial Skyrim Patch, SkyUI is seen as essential by most players. Apocalypse, on the other hand, revamps <em>Skyrim</em>'s (admittedly somewhat lackluster) magic system, so that it has much more depth and complexity. Among other things, Apocalypse forces magic-using players to interact with and search <em>Skyrim</em>'s overworld more and radically changes the perks and powers of the diverging magic paths so that they don't even resemble their incarnations in vanilla <em>Skyrim</em>. Both mods massively impact how players interact with and play <em>Skyrim</em>, though in different ways.</p>

					<p>So because these parts of the game were overhauled, does that mean there's a flaw in the game's fundamental design? Probably not. The choice to add <em>Pokemon</em> into <em>Minecraft</em> is one that only resonates with specific players; other players won't really care because they aren't interested in <em>Pokemon</em> and don't see a gap in <em>Minecraft</em> that necessitates adding in <em>Pokemon</em>. Also, consider that plenty of players experience <em>Skyrim</em> without SkyUI or Apocalypse, and still greatly enjoy the game. While <em>Skyrim</em>'s UI problably should have been overhauled when it was put on PC, and its magic system might be somewhat lackluster, plenty of players are fine with the core game as-is. This is another case of "if the itch exists, scratch it"; that itch won't exist for some players, and that's perfectly fine.</p>

					<p>At the same time, while overhauls might not indicate immediate flaws themselves, they could still indicate areas for improvement. Granted, adding <em>Pokemon</em> to <em>Minecraft</em> might be an extremely specific use that can only work in a modding context, but the usage of Pixelmon could still point to a broader desire to have additional ways to gather resources or to have more friendly mobs, or be able to interact with them more meaningfully. Or conversely, UI and magic system overhauls for <em>Skyrim</em> indicate that those are specific areas which need more attention. Those are changes specific to amend those two areas, which can indicate when an aspect of a game needed more thought or reveal incorrect assumptions by developers.</p>

					<br/>
					<h3 class="text-center">CONCLUSION</h3>
					<br/>

					<p>So circling back to the main question here: <strong>how should mods relate to the core game?</strong></p>

					<p>Honestly, there's not really a clear answer for that. I think the best answer is that mods should relate in ways to the core game such that they don't accidentally (or purposefully!) illustrate problems the game has. That's not a statement that mods shouldn't add content that belongs in the main game, or that they shouldn't fix fundamental problems and bugs with the main experience; rather, I mean that if a mod does add, amend, or overhaul content, it should reflect well on the base game.</p>

					<p>Gaps that exist in a game are inevitable, and of course, some players will find them to be larger problems that others. Some might not notice at all, and so these issues might be so comparatively minor that they don't really matter. But games should endeavor to deliver as complete and bug-free an experience as possible, such that there don't need to be mods that fix major issues, and content additions or overhauls come down largely to personal preference, rather than because of a feeling of saminess or ineffectiveness.</p>

					<p>As I write this, I'm recalling that I have some 30 mods installed for <em>Skyrim</em>, some of which are just goofy texture changes, some of which add content to the base game, and some of which that completely overhaul parts of the game. I see all of them (minus <em>maybe</em> the goofy ones) as necessary to actually experience being the hero in a fantasy RPG world. I'm also remembering that Pixelmon is my single favorite mod for <em>Minecraft</em>, and that nowadays I'm more likely to play Pixelmon than vanilla Minecraft or <em>Pokemon</em>, both because I love the mod so much and because it gives me an experience I've just never had in a <em>Pokemon</em> game. I still enjoy base <em>Skyrim</em> and <em>Minecraft</em>, but nowadays, it's hard to imagine playing either game without the  mods I've installed.</p>

					<p>So even with all that said, even though I do think a game's main selling point should always be the quality of the base product itself, mods really can enhance the experience if the game can facilitate them. Ultimately, the choice to install mods is up to the player, and so the installation of mods is dependent on players' satisfaction with their experience. Mods can add to, fix, and overhaul the game, revealing design or technical missteps in the process, but their value is player-dependent, and therefore their relation to the core game is - and must be - fluid.</p>

					<hr/>

					<p>This past weekend, I participated in the Global Game Jam, an international event in which teams work to make a game (board, video, or otherwise) within 48 hours. It's basically a hackathon, but for games (so it's inherently better), and unlike most hackathons, it has a specific theme associated with it. And some really cool games have emerged from these kinds of themed game jams; the most recent and famous example probably being the smash hit, mind-bending puzzle game <em>Baba is You</em>. [1].</p>

					<p>The merits of the Global Game Jam, and game jams in general, are espoused by more seasoned game developers, industry professionals, and professors, because if nothing else, the game jam is an excellent <strong>teaching tool</strong>. The short nature of the jam forces its participants to design fast and fail faster to get a product built, and this is constrained further by the theme. Therefore, the jam is often described as a hallmark in teaching how to rapidly design, prototype, and balance scope within a limited timeframe. People use these jams to learn things like how to work with others, use a new tool or engine, and acquire new knowledge in a software tool. Those are what you learn from a game jam.</p>

					<p>I've been to two Global Game Jams now, and they've been very different. In the first jam I attended, I went with an assigned group as part of the course Game Design, Prototyping, and Production. The theme was "Home", and we decided on an RPG-style game that was basically Homer's Odysssey meets <em>FTL</em>. Needless to say, it was way too big for a game jam game, and was a total disaster. We barely had a toy, not a game, at the end, we had no RPG combat system, and there was very limited dialogue and movement, because it was the only part of the game that actually worked. What I learned here was the lessons above: scope small, know your limits, figure out your MVP early, and know when to cut back or revise your design. My group was awesome, and I loved working with them the rest of the semester, but we came out of that jam feeling beaten and battered.</p>

					<p>And sure, in my second Global Game Jam these ideas came up again. It was what <em>else</em> I learned that made me want to write about it.</p>

					<br/>
					<h3 class="text-center">THE SUPERGROUP BRAINSTORMAPALOOZA</h3>
					<br/>

					<p>I didn't have a class-assigned group this year. Instead, I went with a group from CMU's undergraduate game design club, the Game Creation Society (GCS), which I'd been a part of for four semesters. The club was filled with people from all kinds of disciplines who knew exactly what they were doing when it came to game development, and by this point I'd gotten over the imposter syndrome that came with that and made some really great friends. We were all pumped to work together and have fun over the weekend just fully diving into the experience.</p>

					<p>The theme this year was <strong>"Repair"</strong> (much better than "Home", in my opinion). It was broad, but definitely got our creative juices flowing, because we got into the line to get dinner and immediately started hashing out ideas. After we finished eating, we found an empty conference room and started whiteboarding.</p>

					<p>And oh man, did we whiteboard.</p>

					<div>
						<img style="width:50%;" class="centered block" src="../images/whiteboarding.jpg"/>
					</div>
					<p class="text-center"><em>This is AFTER we started axing the out-of-scope ideas. Poor Adrian here was their executioner.<br/>
					[Own image]</em></p>
					<br/>

					<p>We ended up with over 20 ideas, and spent an agonizing three or so hours just going through all of them and trying to figure out what would work and what wouldn't. Among the killed games were games that required VR setups, an FTL-like resource management game, and games that were literally just puns on the word "repair". At the end, we came out with 3 ideas: a bullet hell, a derby game, and a matchmaking game, all of which we seemed to fit the theme and were scopeable. Then we broke off into two groups, with 7 people joining the derby team and 5 people joining the matchmaking game; I joined the matchmaking game.</p>

					<p>This leads to the first lesson I learned.</p>

					<hr/>
					<h4>First Lesson: Kill a Lot of Babies, Even Your Own</h4>

					<p>It felt like an eternity, but the "purge" was ultimately a good thing, because it stopped the group from rolling with an idea that sounded great but was completely out of scope or poorly-defined. Immediately, I just wanted us to pick something and split teams from there, but through exploring every idea we had, we were able to not just determine what seemed like the best ideas in a limited timeframe, but what we would all actually enjoy working on.</p>

					<p>I say that because although everyone pitched in at least one idea, we went through all of them and then voted both on how scopeable they would be and how much we actually wanted to work on them. We killed a lot of cool ideas this way, like a Grim Reaper-themed game, one which involved creating mechs, and an <em>Overcooked</em>-style game which saw you as the IT guy for an organization (that was my idea, and I still like it, but I'm happy we killed it). By doing this process, we were able to commit to ideas which saw several passionate members working on them, and feel that the products would come out fine in the end.</p>
					<hr/>

					<br/>
					<h3 class="text-center">IT REALLY MAKES YOU <em>FEEL</em> LIKE THE TINDER ALGORITHM</h3>
					<br/>

					<p>The matchmaking game was originally pitched as "You Are Tinder", and it would be known that way for most of development. The core idea was that you were acting as Tinder's algorithm, trying to match people together and have them fall in love, then see if that actually worked. It was a cute idea, and one that appeared to be very easily reduceable. It was also very interesting from a game design perspective, because how do you make Tinder a game? And that was the one caveat: the idea was really solid, but how we would make it wasn't really clear. </p>

					<p>So I joined the project to try and figure out exactly what kind of game it would actually be, because Iâ€™d never worked on anything like it before. There was another key component in my joining, however: I had never worked with anyone on the team before (consisting of my friends Jan, Jess, Grace, and Sebastian). I had worked with Grace on one project previously, but I never touched the art pipeline or needed to talk to her, and I was friends with everyone there, but again, they were new to me as teammates.</p>

					<p>But I knew one thing: they were all really good at their jobs, and it was clear they'd all bring something different to the project, which was a good omen. We ended up discussing design only a minimum amount that night and doing no development on the game, leaving the first day with basically no work on the game finished yet, so we would have to get all non-polish items in on Saturday. The next day, we went straight to work. There was basically no space in the main area of the jam, so we instead went to Hamburg Hall, across the street from the jam site, the Tepper Quad.</p>

					<hr/>
					<h4>Second Lesson: Lock Down Design</h4>

					<p>We basically went until noon that day just deciding what the core gameplay felt like, who would do what, and what the gameplay loop looked like. No more dancing around it - what is this game about? What systems and elements are involved in it? What do typical play sessions look like? And after we figured all of it out, we didn't touch it again.</p>

					<p>I think this is pretty much one of our best decisions; after a certain point, it's no longer helpful to vist and revisit design, because you'll just be wasting time, so just try to pump something out. If there was a problem or inconsistency, it wasn't worth whiteboarding, so we just asked each other what to do. Design can be changed, but you won't know if it has to be changed until you start putting it in, and minor changes do not need the whiteboard.</p>
					<hr/>

					<p>We actually stayed in Hamburg just working until 1 PM or so, because they had easy access to whiteboards and their classrooms were quiet. Granted, the pizza they ordered was cold when we got back to the Tepper Quad, but at least we had established a baseline for our game by that point and even begun programming. I'd figured out what I was doing, at least - I planned on creating CSVs and reading from them to help randomize character options.</p>

					<div>
						<img style="width:50%;" class="centered block" src="../images/image0.jpg"/>
					</div>
					<p class="text-center"><em>We smelled faintly of dry-erase markers the whole weekend.<br/>
					[Own image]</em></p>
					<br/>

					<p>We decided the game should be about trying to pair one individual from a stack of people on the left side of the screen to someone on the right side, using what they have in common as a sort of compatibility metric. Each person would be randomly generated, pulling values from CSVs, but at least one individual would share a couple complementary traits with the person needing a match. Players would match up characters together by swiping the card they wanted to match right, or swipe left to cycle through their options.</p>

					<br/>
					<h3 class="text-center">PEOPLE MATTER</h3>
					<br/>

					<p>While we were in Hamburg we decided what everyone would work on, and initially, it looked like three programmers, one artist, and one sound designer. We managed to get reasonably far before we returned to the Tepper Quad; we had our background music loop, some character pictures, and the randomization system, along with lists of traits for people to use.</p>

					<p>Amazingly, there was still no room in the main area of the jam, so we just headed upstairs and grabbed a table with a lot of outlets. We divided up work, and then the grind began.</p>

					<hr/>
					<h4>Third Lesson: Compartmentalize and Communicate</h4>

					<p>Because we were working, we naturally drifted towards subgroups. I had one programmer (Sebastian) helping me with the randomization and implementation, while another programmer, Jess, helped Jan, who acted as the sound designer (later the UI expert), and the artist, Grace. We worked feverishly on our own facets of the project, but it was frequent that someone felt like they should let the group know about something, or needed the details from someone else on their part of the game.</p>

					<p>I've done this type of thing before, of course, but I was always able to ask something and then go back to what I was doing without needing to worry about anything. But because this project was smaller than most, ironically, I had to be concerned with a lot more, so knowing how everything would fit together was critical, and therefore I had to talk to members a lot to see how an aspect of the game was doing. In a weird way, I was kind of forced to confront that fact in this game jam.</p>
					<hr/>

					<p>I refined the random generation system a bit, Sebastian wrote up a compatibility calculator, Jess worked on the post-match event timeline (to give the player feedback on their matchmaking skills and give them an idea on how successful the pairing was), Jan switched over to working on showing the character bios, and Grace kept drawing character art (and wow, is it nice art). But after about an hour of working and creating small, pieces of the puzzle, we kind of hit a wall, because we realized we wouldn't get very far without integrating the system for character bios to spawn and then be swiped away. We also needed to write dialogue options that would be generated for each character, in order to hint at their attributes.</p>

					<div>
						<img style="width:50%;" class="centered block" src="../images/UI_1.png"/>
					</div>
					<p class="text-center"><em>Artistic mockup of the bios. Sadly, emojis did not make the final cut.</em> ðŸ˜¢<br/>
					<em>[Own image]</em></p>
					<br/>

					<p>So while Jan worked on getting character bios to appear and getting them to be paired up, someone had to do the unenviable task of writing the dialogue. That someone was me.</p>

					<hr/>
					<h4>Fourth Lesson: People Aren't Defined by One Skill</h4>

					<p>I like writing. I do it a lot in my off-time. But it's not my major; I like software development about as much as I do writing, so I just tend to gravitate towards the programmer role in most projects and leave story and writing to someone else. And that's fine.</p>

					<p>But it does mean that I've kind of pigeon-holed myself and unconsciously worked to just become a better software developer rather than a more holistic game designer (and to be clear, the two aren't mutually exclusive). Handling the dialogue in this project suddenly showed me that fact, that I've focused too much on one aspect to remember that I'm decent at something else. As a result, I felt like I was making a much more meaningful contribution to the project because I came at it from multiple sides.</p>

					<p>I wasn't the only one who did this, either. Fro example, Sebastian helped with the writing for the characters' dates, as well as design, and Jan had to utilize his UI design skills and create cool background music. And the overall package ended up being better for it, because not pigeon-holing ourselves led to a much more holistic package.</p>

					<p>It's not that the game jam helped me rekindle a love for writing or made me discover a passion for it or anything. It's that it showed me that mixed skillsets can exist in game development and software projects, and they're sometimes necessary, given the size of a team and the deadline of a project.</p>
					<hr/>

					<p>I ended up spending three hours writing all of the possible options for the character bios. I really enjoyed it, but man, did it feel like it took an eternity. But it was fulfilling, because at the end we had 60 different lines (20 trait-specific lines, with 3 variations each), so we could finally get the writing in and get to an MVP stage for playtesting. The only thing remaining was integrating all of the systems, which had been independently developed.</p>

					<div>
						<img style="width:50%;" class="centered block" src="../images/IMG_2731.JPG"/>
					</div>
					<p class="text-center"><em>You can feel the romantic tension behind those words.<br/>
					[Own image]</em></p>
					<br/>

					<p>So we went downstairs again, and at long last, a table was available in the game jam space. Our sister GCS group seemed to be doing well with their derby game, and so we began swapping playtesters. We also received some other playtesters in the form of the Schell Games attendees. And our playtesters gave us feedback.</p>

					<hr/>
					<h4>Fifth Lesson: Take Feedback that Supports the Vision</h4>

					<p>We received a lot of feedback. Generally, people liked the game, but there was actually some variety in what they said. One playtester would say they didn't know what they were doing, another got it quickly. A playtester would say that the game needed an end goal and more player interaction, another said that it was fun as is. one player loved it, another player didn't enjoy it much.</p>

					<p>It's not really surprising that people reacted to this game in different ways, because it's meant to be a casual experience and will naturally just appeal to some more than others. But for us, some of the feedback we received just didn't meet that vision, and addressing that was difficult. Initial feedback worried me that we'd picked a bad route, that we should'be made something easier to digest.</p>

					<p>I pretty much knew we were on the right path when one playtester exclaimed to another, "See, I told you about Amanda! She's a lost cause!", and when playtesters laughed at the weird jokes and references in the randomization and bio messages (they included the Star Wars prequels, pineapples on pizza, and anime). The consistent pieces of feedback were that what players were doing was unclear and they struggled to initially learn the controls. So our fears were mostly assuaged - we just needed to be clearer to the players about how to match people up, maybe have a screen to tell them what to do, and find a way to have them subtly learn how a relationship would work out.</p>

					<p>So in the end, we did figure out how to improve the game, and how to do it without compromising on our vision.</p>
					<hr/>

					<p>After this point, we called it a day and people went home. I stayed behind for a few hours to try and fix some nagging issues and address some more minor playtesting feedback. I felt pretty good about the product - now all that we had to do was polish.</p>

					<p>Easier said than done.</p>

					<br/>
					<h3 class="text-center">DAWN OF THE FINAL DAY</h3>
					<br/>

					<p>Sunday was the last day of the jam, and consequently, polish day. It was a little stressful, because we had an hour less to work with than normal thanks to the Super Bowl, and there were still things that we wanted to get in and fix that we hand't addressed yet. We needed an introductory screen, so the player knew who they were and what they were doing, and end state, an ending screen, music implementation, more art integration, and an overhaul to the text that appears on a date.</p>

					<p>It was a lot, but it was totally manageable. Once again dividing up the work really helped us out - I did minor art implementation, tweaks, and edits, Sebastian rewrote the date text, Jess got the start and end screens in, Jan applied hotfixes and implemented music, and Grace cranked out amazing art within an even shorter amount of time. We still felt the walls closing in, but we were determined and confident.</p>

					<p>It was also here that we actually figured out what to call this game: <strong>Pair of Hearts</strong>.</p>

					<div>
						<img style="width:20%;" class="centered block" src="../images/logo_1.png"/>
					</div>
					<p class="text-center"><em>The final logo for the game, partially inspired by butterflies.<br/>
					[Own image]</em></p>
					<br/>

					<p>Up until this point we'd only called it "You Are Tinder". Yeah.</p>

					<p>We managed to get pretty much all of it in before the deadline, as well as redesign the UI to make it more readable, implement more fonts to give every bio a personal feeling, and make some additional quality-of-life tweaks. We built it, turned it in, gave ourselves some pats on the back, and prepared for the showcase. I was still kind of afraid it would randomly break halfway through. Oh well.</p>

					<p>Our first player in the showcase was a judge. No pressure.</p>

					<hr/>
					<h4>Sixth Lesson: Aim to Create the Whole, Not Just Add the Parts</h4>

					<p>For as much as I was worried that the game would suddenly implode and players would sit there kind of awkwardly staring at the screen, it didn't happen. Instead what happened was that players would come up to the game, laugh as they scrolled through the bios, comment on how pretty everything looked, and make a noise like "awww", or "ooooh" and comment on how wholesome the game was. We got compliments on how polished it was and questions on how we generated the bios. Holy crap, people liked this! And they wanted to know about it - about how it came together.</p>

					<p>And this told me one big reason why my first game jam failed: we didn't aim to create the whole game, we aimed to create a bunch of unique bits and then staple them together. With this game, we did the opposite, and aimed to create something more than the sum of its parts. The last bit of writing I contributed to this game was the text at the ending screen; it was at first a half-suggestion made in passing, but it ended up being a good "bow" on top that tied the package together. It read: "Matches Mended! Now go out there and find your true love." We created individual pieces of this project, but because we were clear on our design and talked, we knew where it was all going, and we knew our vision.</p>

					<p>As for the judge? He really liked it.</p>
					<hr/>

					<p>My team and I took turns roaming around, looking at all of the different, creative ways people thought of how to make a game from "Repair". After a few hours of playing our friends' games and seeing what the wider Pittsburgh game development community had created, I sat down in the bleachers to prepare for the award ceremony. Honestly, just getting a finished product that you're happy with is enough of a win in a game jam, but it's cool to see those who definitely put in effort be recognized.</p>

					<p>And then something weird happened. As we sat there waiting for the awards showcase to end so we could pack up, one of the judges stepped up to the poduim and presented the Diversity Award, for a game that encompassed a breadth of subjects and did them all pretty well. They started talking about a game about mending broken relationships and which covered serious subjects, but handled everything with comedy and fun, and made for a final product that was about trying to bring people together. And after the longest fake out I've ever experienced, he said the name.</p>

					<p>Pair of Hearts.</p>

					<hr/>
					<h4>Seventh Lesson: A Good Game Isn't Predefined</h4>
					<p>The diversity of games at the game jam really speaks to the diversity of games in general. There are a myriad of ideas you could focus a game around, and any one of them can be successful given a grounded project vision, even in a game jam. You will love some ideas, hate others, and ultimately, you'll probably settle for something that wasn't quite what you envisioned, but it can work.</p>

					<p>My poor product at the first GGJ I attended led me to believe that maybe some ideas were just doomed to fail, that maybe some games were better than others because of their concepts alone. But now I think the problem isn't with a concept, it's with scope and execution. You could have a really great concept, but put it in terms that make it horribly out of scope, and develop it so that it fulfills that prophecy. The key is figuring out whether you want to make the game, figuring out how, and then being clear with your team about the process.</p>

					<p>Pair of Hearts winning the Diversity Award didn't mean that much, and I would remember the jam fondly even without it, but it did verify that this process was good, and it was the final "click" that helped me realize how much I'd learned from just this one experience. You don't need something flashy, massive, or incerdibly mature to elicit joy out of people. You just need a good idea and good execution.</p>

					<h3 class="text-center">LESSONS IN A NUTSHELL</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Be flexible and adaptive early on in the ideating process.</li>
						<li>Establish a design early. Then go, and don't look back until you have to.</li>
						<li>Subgroups are fine - as long as they can communicate with one another.</li>
						<li>Even the most narrow position will be manned by someone eitrh several skills.</li>
						<li>Feedback is critical, but don't get too hung up on it. Iterate and move on.</li>
						<li>A game is great when it is greater than the sum of its parts.</li>
						<li>A good game isn't predefined.</li>

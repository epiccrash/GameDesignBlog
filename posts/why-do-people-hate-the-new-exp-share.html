					<p>As the series has evolved over the years, Pokemon has seen many changes and additions to its core gameplay systems. Each new generation of games has introduced a new mechanic or a new typing, or modified how existing Pokemon, attacks, and features have worked. Generally, these additions and changes have been seen as small, fun, or necessary enough that they've been met positively by players. These changes were also implemented often to create game balance, generally without impacting player experience or progression as they played through the main game.</p>

					<p>One item that received tweaks continually throughout the series was the <strong>Exp. Share</strong>. The Exp. Share is a tool the player can use to help weaker Pokemon catch up to stronger ones more quickly; in essence, it reduces the grinding the player has to do, a blessing in an RPG. This is especially useful because as players progress through the game, they may find some Pokemon that they want to use, but these Pokemon will naturally be weaker than those on their team. Giving a new Pokemon the Exp. Share gives them half of the experience points received in battle, even if they didn't participate in it. In exchange, the Pokemon who did battle will receive half of the experience they would otherwise get.</p>

					<p>For over a decade, the Exp. Share functioned this way, receiving only minor modifications; however, in 2013, with the release of <em>Pokemon X and Y</em>, it changed significantly. Now, the Exp. Share wasn't an item players gave to their Pokemon, but one that could be toggled on and off, and instead of giving half of the experience to only one Pokemon, it gave experience to every Pokemon in the player's party. Additionally, the Pokemon that did fight in the battle now received the full amount of experience they would normally receive, and every other Pokemon in the party received half of that amount.</p>

					<br/>

					<p>While it seems like this would be a beneficial change, reducing the need to grind even further, many players responded negatively to the change. But why? What about this seemingly positive change suddenly turned one of the series's most beloved items into one of its most hated?</p>

					<p>Well, the immediate answer is that it removed all meaningful downsides to using the item, and in doing so harmed progression through the game. Specifically, this change negatively affected the player experience of the games in two areas: <strong>challenge</strong> and <strong>choice</strong>.</p>

					<!-- Challenge, Achievement, and Choice -->

					<br/>
					<h3 class="text-center">(A LACK OF) CHALLENGE</h3>
					<br/>

					<p>One major reason why players rebelled against the change to the Exp. Share was because it severely reduced the difficulty of the game. Specifically, it had no negative side effects and was obtained much earlier.</p>

					<p>The old Exp. Share didn't reduce the challenge of a Pokemon game because the item had an implicit trade-off associated with it. In giving a Pokemon the Exp. Share, the player agreed to reduce the rate at which their leading Pokemon leveled up, thereby imposing a challenge on themselves. The leveling curve of a "crutch" Pokemon is significantly reduced in the short term, in the hope that in the long term, the other Pokemon will pay dividends, and it is this reduction that allows the old Exp. Share to exist without being overpowered.</p>

					<p>The new Exp. Share, on the other hand, does reduce the challenge of  the game because it has no trade-off. Turning the Exp. Share on distributes experience evenly among the party, but the Pokemon that battles receives as much experience as they would with the Exp. Share turned off. The levelling rate of the lead Pokemon stays the same, while every other Pokemon's levelling rates increase (instead of just one Pokemon's levelling rate increasing), removing the need to compromise and balance, thereby reducing difficulty and causing overleveling.</p>

					<p>A second reason why the new Exp. Share reduces the game's challenge is because it is introduced extremely early on in the main game. In games prior to <em>X and Y</em>, the Exp. Share was only obtainable after a significant amount of playtime, journeying through the map, and/or catching a certain amount of Pokemon. In other words, the old Exp. Share was sufficiently gated that the player obtained it at a point when they could benefit from it, but not cheese the rest of the game using it.</p>

					<p>The new Exp. Share, however, is obtained immediately after beating the first Gym in <em>X and Y</em> (the player literally receives it as they leave the town). Receiving the Exp. Share so soon wouldn't be the core issue on its own, but in conjunction with the item's ability to level every Pokemon up at once, this early gift allows the player to become overleveled very quickly. Because this Exp. Share is poorly gated, the player will become more powerful than the Trainers they face before their journey is even far underway.</p>

					<p>With the new Exp. Share, every Pokemon you keep in your party becomes near-instantly viable and more powerful than their opponents, minimizing challenge. As counterintuitive as it seems, players hate this because it directly impacts their own sense of accomplishment. Overcoming challenge, either through grinding, willpower, or strategy, is what makes players feel like they've achieved something through their own work. The more that the game progressively reduces challenge, the less achieved players feel. And because the new Exp. Share results in constant overleveling, it widens the power gap between players and their opponents even more, so players don't feel a strong sense of achievement.</p>

					<br/>
					<h3 class="text-center">(A LACK OF) CHOICE</h3>
					<br/>

					<p>The second impact of this change to the Exp. Share is on the player's choice in using it. After all, if players hate this so much, why not just turn off this new Exp. Share? The answer is simple: there is no compelling reason to do so.</p>

					<p>With the old Exp. Share, the players could have good reasons to take it off of a Pokemon. As stated earlier, it speeds up how quickly one Pokemon levels up by reducing the leveling rate of another, so if the player needs their leading Pokemon to be stronger, they will remove the Exp. Share. Additionally, the Exp. Share takes up a valuable item slot that can otherwise be used to boost the power of attacks or help them defensively, so if the player is considering using the weaker Pokemon in battle, they have to give up the leveling boost. And finally, another Pokemon might need it, or the weaker Pokemon might now be more balanced with the rest of the party.</p>

					<p>Players have no incentive to disable the new Exp. Share because it has no negative side effects, and those that it might have are far too hidden or specific for players to care about them. Keeping the Exp. Share active provides levels to everyone at nearly the same rate, so underleveling no longer exists (and instead, leads to overleveling). It is also no longer a held item, so players don't need to decide whether to remove it from a Pokemon or not, and because it levels up all Pokemon at once, all Pokemon are always balanced with one another. The new Exp. Share is not just powerful, it is practically a dominant strategy; by not using it a player puts themselves in a weaker state.</p>

					<p>The sole downside to keeping the Exp. Share enabled from a mechanical standpoint is that it means some Pokemon will get bonus stat points in stats players may not want them to optimize in. Pokemon get small bonus points in specific stats when they defeat specific Pokemon; the Exp. Share gives these points equally across the entire party. However, this is a mechanic that is so hidden that Pokemon games barely even discuss it, most players don't know about it, and when playing through the main game, it will likely have no visible gameplay effect. A mechanic that does not automatically optimize is not an inherent downside to most players.</p>

					<p>Turning off the Exp. Share can increase the challenge of the game, sure, but this contains a significant issue: if a player wants challenge, or wants to level up just one Pokemon, there is no sufficient alternative. Players will have to either train with specifically only the Pokemon they want to level up, which leads to its own form of grinding and can underswing the levels of the entire party, or they have to overlevel every Pokemon. There is no compromise; players can stay above the curve and minimize grinding, or they can slog through and struggle to keep pace. This presents the Exp. Share as a purely positive benefit, making the choice to disable it appear foolish.</p>

					<br/>
					<h3 class="text-center">WHY DOES ANY OF THIS MATTER?</h3>
					<br/>

					<p>Implications from this one analysis seem limited; after all, this is one item from one series. But it reveals how good intentions can be received so negatively by players, and how design changes ripple through a game.</p>

					<p>First, it demonstrates that even though they probably won't like grinding, <strong>players want to earn the levels they get</strong>. Providing players with a mechanic that speeds up how fast they get those levels is great, but providing an incrase without meaningful risk can trivialize encounters.</p>

					<p>Second, it highlights that <strong>strong items need strong gates</strong>. Handing a player a powerful item should come a significant portion into their playthrough, because doing so otherwise makes the game's difficulty seem arbitrary. Had players received the old Exp. Share in the beginning and gotten the new Exp. Share after the game was beaten, the new Exp. Share would have been an extremely useful postgame tool, and the game's challenge would remain intact.</p>

					<p>Third, it shows that <strong>mechanical changes have consequences across the rest of the game</strong>. In a medium and a series that thrives on player choice, the decision to remove the downsides to a useful item reduced the real amount of choice and control a player had, which made players feel unfulfilled.</p>

					<p>Finally, <strong>it affects the series' design philosophy moving forward</strong>. Future Pokemon games did not roll the Exp. Share back to the one players liked more, nor did they make a separate item that resembled it. Instead, the most recent title in the series removes player choice and the question of gating altogether by making the Exp. Share a built-in, cannot-be-disabled mechanic. Many responded negatively to the change, as they had when the Exp. Share was overhauled in <em>X and Y</em>.</p>

					<p>The Exp. Share is a solid example of overcorrecting and misjudgment, a good idea implemented poorly. In order to prevent a mechanical change from having a profound ripple effect on the game, developers need to consider how that change will ultimately help players while still allowing them to feel achieved and like they have meaningful agency.</p>

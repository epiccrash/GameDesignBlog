					<p>Imagine: you're playing Risk with your best friends at their house. You have a reasonably powerful army, and you're building up cards and resources so you can finally take South America. You fortify your base in Central America a little bit, putting the bulk of your army there with the expectation that it will rebuff any attacking force without losing too many units, as it has the entire game. You then launch an attack into Peru, owned by one of your friends, who has given up on defending it and instead invested in Western Europe, and then launch a second offense into Argentina, owned by another friend who has very little land left and has put most of his units there. Against his desperate pleas and bargaining, you storm the area with a dozen troops, and after a brief skirmish, watch the light fade from his eyes as you take South America.</p>

					<p>You put some troops into Venezuela, not really expecting anything to happen. Play then passes to a third friend. He's spread his troops across Canada and fended off attacks from Russia, so he hasn't been a major threat all game, but-- wait, what? He just turned in like 6 Risk cards and got a ton of troops! He puts them all in Quebec, and begins his march south. He takes the Eastern US, then the Western US, and finally, after a long, hard fight and several tense dice rolls, your base, Central America. You plead for him to stop, but he gives you an evil, knowing grin, and within two minutes, your new empire in South America is now part of his empire. Your hands clutch your temples, your jaw drops, and you let out a gutteral sigh, as you realize you have only a few territories left, with very few troops in them. These must be your last bastions of hope.</p>

					<p>You have just given and felt the sweet embrace of <strong>despair</strong>.</p>

					<p>Despair is kind of hard to articulate. A lot of games, like <em>Dark Souls</em>, saturate their atmospheres with complete and total despair, so the player is submerged in it. This, however, is not the kind of despair I'm talking about. The kind of despair I'm talking about is the kind that only arises in multiplayer games, and in games such as <em>Risk</em>, <em>Settlers of Catan</em>, Monopoly, and <em>Mario Kart</em>.</p>

					<p>When I talk about despair, what I really mean is the instant that a player starts feeling completely, totally screwed. Feeling despair in multiplayer games is watching your lead, your foundation, or your hope completely evaporate thanks to one of your friends. It's not the same feeling as facing overwhelming odds; it's the same feeling as watching a trainwreck happen in slow motion. It's a visceral, ugly feeling, but we love to make our friends experience it, and it's crucial to our own game experience. But... why?</p>


					<br/>
					<h3 class="text-center">IT MAKES YOU FEEL POWERFUL</h3>
					<br/>

					<p>Despair is more than an emotion. It is a <em>weapon</em>.</p>

					<p>If your friend is doing well, even threatening your chances at victory, naturally, you're going to find a way to overtake them, and undercut their own chances of victory. Finding a weakness in your friend's strategy, or predicting their moves in advance, enables you to prevent that from happening altogether and open up an opportunity to surpass or eternally doom your friend. This dramatically decreases their chances of winning, and as they slowly realize what's just happened to them, they feel despair, and you, the actor, feel great.</p>

					<p class="text-center"><em>There can only be one.<br/>

					<br/>

					<p>Not only have you put yourself in a better position, you have removed or reduced a threat to your own success. This boosts your sense of accomplishment further, and you feel ridiculously powerful. You have effectively weaponized despair to shift the balance of power (and make your friend really angry at you).</p>

					<p> Making your friends feel despair sounds very bad; surely, after all, you don't want to make your friends develop a seething hatred for you over the course of one game. Yet friends often play these kinds of games together. Games like <em>Mario Kart</em> are often jokingly described as ones that destroy friendships, but the conflict that develops within a game tends to stay in the game; despair doesn't last.</p>

					<p>Of course, it's not so easy to fel great about being destroyed. But there is a silver lining to it.</p>


					<br/>
					<h3 class="text-center">COMING BACK FEELS SO MUCH SWEETER</h3>
					<br/>

					<p>Even at your worst, lowest point in a multiplayer game, your objective stays the same: <em>win</em>. You might have been boxed in, stabbed in the back, cut down, or passed by, but you're not out. Sure, you might <em>feel</em> totally screwed, but you can always have hope against hope for a miraculous comeback.</p>

					<p>Sometimes you really are defeated, with no hope of returning to the game. But there is no feeling better in a multiplayer game than coming back from nothing, or from the worst position possible, to strike fear in everyone else. It makes a player feel like they've endured something that should have doomed them, and that they've truly earned their newfound power, either through luck, craftiness, or skill. In such a way, despair "wipes clean" a player's emotional state, and can pave the way for players to feel more powerful and be more determined than before, increasing their investment in the game.</p>

					<p>The emotional high brought on by coming back from despair is further enhanced when game mechanics or tactics allow for comebacks to emerge, however improbable. For example, in <em>Risk</em>, through extraordinary luck and dedicated turtling tactics, a player can gradually produce more safe spots, cut their opponents' continent bonuses, and pull off an admirable comeback. In <em>Settlers of Catan</em>, if your opponents decide to box you in and shut down your main strategy, you can come back using sneakier tactics, like spending resources to get cards and achieve victory through those supplemental point bonuses. And finally, in <em>Mario Kart</em>, when you're at the back, you have the highest chances of getting the best items in the game, which can rocket you forward or destroy another player's lead.</p>

					<a href="https://medium.com/board-game-brother/how-to-play-settlers-of-catan-e51c5a5aa499">Source</a></em></p>
					<br/>

					<p>These are underhanded, entirely luck-based mechanics. But when you're at the bottom, you gotta get back to the top somehow. And getting back makes for a great player story.</p>


					<br/>
					<h3 class="text-center">IT WRITES A PLAYER STORY</h3>
					<br/>

					<p>Despair is a key element in creating a memorable game experience. A player who gets unbelievably crushed by another player will remember how it happened and how it made them feel. It creates a lasting, powerful image of their defeat. Or, if they came back from that defeat to win the game, they'll remember how fantastic that felt, and how they did it. Conversely, the player who doomed that other player will also remember what they did, and remember how powerful they felt when they saw their friend's head in their hands or heard them make a sound like their soul is escaping their body.</p>

					<p>In this way, despair enables players to remember their successes and failures; it frames the actions of the game as a narrative and a drama. The player story crafted from these experiences provide value to the game itself, even if the game's creators didn't intend for a specific story to emerge. It also provides a good reason to play the game again; maybe the last player story ended in you losing and despairing in your failure, so playing again offers a chance at redemption.</p>

					<p>Within a player story, players experience a myriad of states. These stories encompass being in a solid position or being on top of the world, and getting knocked down, surprised, utterly broken. Despair is in some form necessary for these stories to emerge and stick, as it helps manipulate players' emotional states to create these emotional highs and lows.</p>


					<br/>
					<h3 class="text-center">CONCLUSION</h3>
					<br/>

					<p>We tend to think of despair as a wholly negative thing, and in most experiences, it is. But within a game environment, despair opens new opportiunities and provides numerous benefits, seen or unseen. Whether you're destroying another player or the one being destroyed, you'll remember the emotional state you were in, whether you emerged from the conlict successful, and come out with a strong impression of how it felt to play the game.</p>

					<p>Designers of competitive multiplayer games need to keep in mind that while players want to feel powerful and excited, crafting an ideal player experience invoves focusing on negative emotions as well as positive ones. Despair, for as much as we don't want to feel it, is important and necessary, so that the high points are all the better.</p>

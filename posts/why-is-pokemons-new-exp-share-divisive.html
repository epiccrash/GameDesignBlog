					<p>As the series has evolved over the years, Pokemon has seen many changes and additions to its core gameplay systems. Each new generation of games has introduced a new mechanic or a new typing, or modified how existing Pokemon, attacks, and features have worked. Generally, these additions and changes have been seen as small, fun, or necessary enough that they've been met positively by players. These changes were also implemented often to create game balance, generally without impacting player experience or progression as they played through the main game.</p>

					<p>One item that received tweaks continually throughout the series was the <strong>Exp. Share</strong>. The Exp. Share is a tool the player can use to help weaker Pokemon catch up to stronger ones more quickly; in essence, it reduces the grinding the player has to do, a blessing in an RPG. This is especially useful because as players progress through the game, they may find some Pokemon that they want to use, but these Pokemon will naturally be weaker than those on their team. Giving a new Pokemon the Exp. Share gives them half of the experience points received in battle, even if they didn't participate in it. In exchange, the Pokemon who did battle will receive half of the experience they would otherwise get.</p>

					<p>For over a decade, the Exp. Share functioned this way, receiving only minor modifications; however, in 2013, with the release of <em>Pokemon X and Y</em>, it changed significantly. Now, the Exp. Share wasn't an item players gave to their Pokemon, but one that could be toggled on and off, and instead of giving half of the experience to only one Pokemon, it gave experience to every Pokemon in the player's party. Additionally, the Pokemon that did fight in the battle now received the full amount of experience they would normally receive, and every other Pokemon in the party received half of that amount.</p>

					<br/>

					<p>While it seems like this would be a strictly beneficial change, reducing the need to grind even further, it proved to be a divisive one. Many players did enjoy this change to the Exp. Share, as it better fit the way they wished to play the game, however many others responded negatively to it. But why? What about this change suddenly turned players against this item? And why did others enjoy this change?</p>

					<p>Players who responded negatively to this change did so for two primary reasons: it removed any downsides to using the item, and in doing so impacted progression through the game. Specifically, this change negatively affected these players' experiences in two areas: <strong>challenge</strong> and <strong>choice</strong>.</p>

					<!-- Challenge and Choice -->

					<br/>
					<h3 class="text-center">(A LACK OF) CHALLENGE</h3>
					<br/>

					<p>One major reason why players rebelled against the change to the Exp. Share was because it severely reduced the difficulty of the game. Specifically, it had no negative side effects and was obtained much earlier.</p>

					<p>The old Exp. Share didn't reduce the challenge of a Pokemon game because the item had an implicit trade-off associated with it. In giving a Pokemon the Exp. Share, the player reduced the rate at which their leading Pokemon leveled up, imposing a challenge on themselves. This significantly reduces the leveling curve of a "crutch" Pokemon in the short term, in the hope that in the long term, the other Pokemon will pay dividends. This reduction allows the old Exp. Share to exist without being overpowered.</p>

					<p>By contrast, the new Exp. Share doesn't have this trade-off. Turning the Exp. Share on distributes experience evenly among the party, but the Pokemon that battles receives as much experience as they would with the Exp. Share turned off. The levelling rate of the lead Pokemon stays the same, while every other Pokemon's levelling rates increase (instead of just one Pokemon's levelling rate increasing). While much more convenient, this reduces the need to compromise and balance, reducing difficulty and causing overleveling. [1]</p>

					<p>A second reason why the new Exp. Share reduces the game's challenge is because it is introduced very early on in the main game. In games prior to <em>X and Y</em>, the Exp. Share was only obtainable after a significant amount of playtime, journeying through the map, and/or catching a certain amount of Pokemon. In other words, the old Exp. Share was sufficiently gated that the player obtained it at a point when they could benefit from it, but not cheese the rest of the game using it.</p>

					<p>The new Exp. Share, however, is obtained immediately after beating the first Gym in <em>X and Y</em>. Receiving the Exp. Share so soon wouldn't be the core issue on its own, but in conjunction with the item's ability to level every Pokemon up at once, this early gift allows the player to become overleveled very quickly. As a result, the player will become more powerful than the Trainers they face before they've played much of the game.</p>

					<p>With the new Exp. Share, every Pokemon you keep in your party becomes more powerful than their opponents, which lowers the challenge, leading some players to call it "Easy Mode" [4]. As counterintuitive as it seems, many players opposed this because it directly impacted their own sense of accomplishment. Overcoming challenge, either through grinding, willpower, or strategy, is what makes players feel like they've achieved something through their own work. Because the new Exp. Share results in overleveling, it widens the power gap between players and their opponents, which can weaken players' sense of achievement.</p>

					<br/>
					<h3 class="text-center">(A LACK OF) CHOICE</h3>
					<br/>

					<p>The second impact of this change to the Exp. Share is on the player's choice in using it. So why wouldn't a player just turn it off? The answer: there is no compelling reason to do so.</p>

					<p>With the old Exp. Share, the players could have reasons to take it off of a Pokemon. It speeds up how quickly one Pokemon levels up by reducing the leveling rate of another, so if the player needs their leading Pokemon to be stronger, they can remove the Exp. Share. Additionally, it takes up a valuable item slot that can otherwise be used to boost the power of attacks or help Pokemon defensively, so if the player is considering using the weaker Pokemon in battle, they have to give up the leveling boost. And finally, another Pokemon might need it, or the weaker Pokemon might now be more balanced with the rest of the party.</p>

					<p>Players have no incentive to disable the new Exp. Share because it has no visibly negative side effects. Keeping the Exp. Share active provides levels to everyone at nearly the same rate, so underleveling no longer exists (and instead, leads to overleveling). It is also no longer a held item, so players don't need to decide whether to remove it from a Pokemon or not, and because it levels up all Pokemon at once, all Pokemon are always balanced with one another. [2] The new Exp. Share is so good an item that it is practically a dominant strategy, because not using it places a player in a strictly weaker state.</p>

					<p>The only mechanical downside to keeping the Exp. Share enabled is that it means some Pokemon will get bonus stat points in stats players may not want them to optimize in. Pokemon get small bonus points in specific stats when they defeat specific Pokemon; the Exp. Share gives these points equally across the entire party. However, this is primarily a metagame mechanic, so most players don't know about it, and when playing through the main game, it will likely have no visible gameplay effect. As such, this isn't an inherent downside to most players.</p>

					<p>Turning off the Exp. Share can increase the challenge of the game, but this poses an issue: if a player wants challenge, or wants to level up just one Pokemon, there is no sufficient alternative. Players will have to either train with specifically only the Pokemon they want to level up, which leads to its own form of grinding and can underswing the levels of the entire party, or they have to overlevel every Pokemon. [3] In order to avoid overleveling, players will have to decide exactly when to turn the Exp. Share off, and risk not keeping pace with the rest of the game.</p>

					<p>With all that said, why did Game Freak make this change? Was there anything gained from changing the Exp. Share?</p>

					<br/>
					<h3 class="text-center">(A MATTER OF) PERSPECTIVE</h3>
					<br/>

					<p>Despite how many players disliked the change made to the Exp. Share, there were also a number of players that liked the change. These players' experience with the new item was markedly different from previous players, as they didn't notice (or didn't mind) the reduction in difficulty, and any accomplishment that might have been reduced thanks to this change was superceded by other positive impacts.</p>

					<p>For example, many players actually felt that they had <em>more</em> opportunities thanks to the new Exp. Share, specifically in the amount of Pokemon they used. These players would shuffle the Pokemon on their team around to use ones that they hadn't before. This helps compensate for the large bonus granted by the Exp. Share, since strong Pokemon are substituted out for weaker ones much more frequently. [5]</p>

					<p>Additionally, these players appreciated the new Exp. Share because it really did cut down on grinding. Previous games may have been more challenging than X and Y, but they did often require grinding. In X and Y, players will rarely need to go into the tall grass to beat specific Pokemon, as they can find that they get most levels just by beating common Trainers and Gym Leaders. [4]</p>

					<p>Game Freak likely modified the Exp. Share functionality as a way to streamline the Pokemon experience and make the game more enjoyable for fans who don't look for challenge in the series. Even though a more "hardcore" audience of those who had played previous games didn't like the change, the portion of Pokemon's audience that didn't look for a challenging experience enjoyed it, because it allowed them to play the game in their preferred way. In doing this, Game Freak better facilitated their playstyle within X and Y, and shifted their focus to lead players to have a new intended experience they might not have been able to achieve before.</p>

					<p>This decision to change the Exp. Share also makes sense regarding Pokemon's core strength as a franchise: it's enjoyable to a wide audience. The more accommodating the franchise is, and the more players feel like they can easily join and experience a game, the more people that can play and enjoy it. Even though one group of that audience wanted a more difficult experience, they are only a subset of the franchise's demographic. While there might be a solution that allowed both this subset and the larger audience to be satisfied, the change makes sense when considering Pokemon's status as a franchise.</p>

					<br/>
					<h3 class="text-center">WHY DOES ANY OF THIS MATTER?</h3>
					<br/>

					<p>Implications from this one analysis seem limited; after all, this is one item from one series. But it reveals how a change can be received so differently by players, and how design changes ripple through a game.</p>

					<p>First, it demonstrates that although they don't want to grind, <strong>players want to earn the levels they get</strong>. Providing players with a mechanic that speeds up how fast they get those levels is great, but providing an increase too quickly can make some players feel less fulfilled for their work, even if others experience the intended relief from grinding.</p>

					<p>Second, it highlights that <strong>strong items need strong gates</strong>. Handing a player a powerful item should come a significant portion into their playthrough, because doing so otherwise makes the game's difficulty seem arbitrary. This is important to some section of the playerbase, especially more long-term players, even if receiving it earlier appeals to another audience.</p>

					<p>Third, it shows that <strong>mechanical changes have consequences across the rest of the game</strong>. Players who didn't like the increase in experience that the new Exp. Share gave found that they didn't really have a choice in disabling it. On the other hand, it led other players to experiment and increase their team size, thereby leading them to try different Pokemon throughout their playthrough.</p>

					<p>Finally, <strong>it affects the series' design philosophy moving forward</strong>. Future Pokemon games did not roll the Exp. Share back to the one that some players liked more, nor did they make a separate item that resembled it. Instead, the most recent title in the series makes the Exp. Share a built-in, cannot-be-disabled mechanic. Many who responded negatively to the change made in X and Y responded similarly to this change.</p>

					<p>The Exp. Share exemplifies both an improvement to player-friendliness and a misjudged overcorrection; though one player group found it beneficial, it alienated and frustrated another. This one change had profound ripple effects throughout the rest of the game, demonstrating the need for developers to consider not only how players will feel as a whole about a mechanical change, but how it will impact different playstyles and whether it will align with player expectations.</p>
